# TriplePlay

# Abstract
The surge in the evolution and complexity of pretrained
models, particularly exemplified by CLIP, presents both op-
portunities and challenges for Federated Learning (FL),
a cornerstone of privacy-preserving artificial intelligence.
This research delves into the intricacies of integrating large
foundation models like CLIP within FL frameworks to en-
hance privacy, efficiency, and adaptability across heteroge-
neous data landscapes. It specifically addresses the chal-
lenges posed by non-IID data distributions, the computa-
tional and communication overheads of leveraging such
complex models, and the skewed representation of classes
within datasets. Through a novel approach that incorpo-
rates CLIP as an adapter, this study aims to improve FLâ€™s
adaptability and performance across diverse data distribu-
tions, tackle the long-tail distribution problem with GAN-
generated synthetic data, and mitigate resource demands
using quantization and low rank adaptation techniques. The
goal is to transcend the limitations of current FL practices
through a multi-faceted approach, offering solutions to en-
hance model performance while maintaining data privacy
and reducing computational demands. Our simulation re-
sults demonstrate that TriplePlay effectively decreases GPU
usage costs and speeds up the learning process, achieving
convergence with reduced communication overhead
